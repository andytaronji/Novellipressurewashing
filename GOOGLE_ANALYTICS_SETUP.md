# Google Analytics Setup Documentation

## Overview
Google Analytics has been successfully implemented on the Novelli Pressure Washing website using the tracking ID `AW-1726312948`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Files Created/Modified

#### Created Files:
- `src/components/analytics/GoogleAnalytics.tsx` - React component for Google Analytics integration

#### Modified Files:
- `next.config.js` - Updated Content Security Policy to allow Google Analytics domains
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Google Analytics component to root layout
- `.env.local` - Added Google Analytics tracking ID environment variable

### 2. Google Analytics Component
The `GoogleAnalytics` component uses Next.js's `Script` component with the `afterInteractive` strategy for optimal performance. It includes:
- Google Tag Manager script loading
- gtag configuration with the tracking ID
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Conditional rendering (only loads if tracking ID is provided)

### 3. Environment Configuration
The tracking ID is stored as an environment variable:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=AW-1726312948
```

### 4. Content Security Policy Updates
Updated CSP in `next.config.js` to allow:
- `*.googletagmanager.com`
- `*.google-analytics.com`
- `*.googleadservices.com`
- `*.doubleclick.net`
- `*.google.com`

Added support for:
- `script-src` - Google Analytics scripts
- `connect-src` - Analytics data collection
- `frame-src` - Google Tag Manager frames

### 5. Integration
The Google Analytics component is integrated into the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) and loads on every page of the website, providing comprehensive tracking across the entire site.

## Verification
The implementation has been tested and verified to:
- Load without Content Security Policy errors
- Integrate properly with the existing Vercel Analytics
- Work across all pages of the website
- Follow Next.js best practices for performance

## Next Steps
1. Verify tracking in Google Analytics dashboard after deployment
2. Set up conversion goals and events as needed
3. Configure enhanced ecommerce tracking if required
4. Consider implementing cookie consent for GDPR compliance

## Notes
- The tracking works alongside existing Vercel Analytics
- In development mode, some analytics features may be limited
- Full functionality will be available once deployed to production
