# Resend Domain Verification Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the Resend domain verification error that was preventing email sending. The contact form should now work perfectly!

## Root Cause
The error was:
```
Resend Error: {
  statusCode: 403,
  error: 'The gmail.com domain is not verified. Please, add and verify your domain on https://resend.com/domains'
}
```

**Problem**: Resend requires domain verification when using Gmail addresses as the sender email. You can't send emails "from" `novellipw@gmail.com` without verifying the gmail.com domain (which is impossible since you don't own Gmail).

## Solution Implemented

### **1. Updated Sender Email (.env.local)**
**Before**: `FROM_EMAIL=novellipw@gmail.com` ❌
**After**: `FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev` ✅

- **`onboarding@resend.dev`** is Resend's pre-verified domain
- **No verification required** - works immediately
- **Professional appearance** - emails come from a legitimate domain

### **2. Added Reply-To Header (API Route)**
**Enhancement**: Added `reply_to: [email]` to email payload

**Benefit**: When you reply to contact form emails, your reply goes directly to the customer who submitted the form, not to the Resend address.

### **3. Kept Recipient Email**
**Unchanged**: `TO_EMAIL=novellipw@gmail.com` ✅

- You still receive all contact form submissions at your Gmail
- Only the sender address changed

## How It Works Now

### **Email Flow:**
1. **Customer submits form** → Contact form on website
2. **Email sent from** → `onboarding@resend.dev` (verified Resend domain)
3. **Email delivered to** → `novellipw@gmail.com` (your Gmail)
4. **Reply goes to** → Customer's email address (via reply-to header)

### **What You'll See:**
- **From**: onboarding@resend.dev
- **To**: novellipw@gmail.com
- **Reply-To**: [customer's email address]
- **Subject**: "New Contact Form Submission from [Customer Name]"

## Testing Instructions

### **Step 1: Restart Development Server**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Test Contact Form**
1. Navigate to your website's contact form
2. Fill out all fields (Name, Email, Message)
3. Submit the form
4. You should see success message instead of error

### **Expected Results:**

#### **Success Scenario:**
- **Browser**: Success message displayed
- **Server Console**: 
  ```
  Environment check: { hasApiKey: true, fromEmail: 'onboarding@resend.dev', toEmail: 'novellipw@gmail.com' }
  Attempting to send email with Resend...
  Resend success: { id: 'resend-message-id' }
  ```
- **Gmail**: Email received from onboarding@resend.dev

#### **Email Content:**
- **Subject**: "New Contact Form Submission from [Name]"
- **From**: onboarding@resend.dev
- **Reply-To**: Customer's email address
- **Content**: Formatted HTML with all form details

## Alternative Solutions (Future Options)

### **Option 1: Custom Domain (Most Professional)**
If you want emails to come from your own domain:
1. **Set up domain** in Resend dashboard
2. **Add DNS records** for domain verification
3. **Use** `contact@novellipressurewashing.com` as FROM_EMAIL
4. **Result**: Emails appear to come from your business domain

### **Option 2: Different Verified Domain**
Resend offers other pre-verified domains:
- `noreply@resend.dev`
- `hello@resend.dev`
- `support@resend.dev`

## Files Modified

### **1. `.env.local`**
```env
# Changed from novellipw@gmail.com to verified domain
FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
TO_EMAIL=novellipw@gmail.com  # Unchanged - you still receive emails
```

### **2. `app/api/contact/route.ts`**
```javascript
// Added reply-to header for proper email threading
const emailContent = {
  from: process.env.FROM_EMAIL,           // onboarding@resend.dev
  to: [process.env.TO_EMAIL],             // novellipw@gmail.com
  reply_to: [email],                      // Customer's email address
  subject: `New Contact Form Submission from ${name}`,
  // ... rest of email content
