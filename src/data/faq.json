    "question": "How often should I have my property pressure washed?",
    "answer": "For most residential properties, we recommend pressure washing once or twice a year. However, this can vary depending on your location, surrounding environment, and specific needs. Commercial properties may require more frequent cleaning, especially high-traffic areas."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is pressure washing safe for all surfaces?",
    "answer": "No, high-pressure washing isn't suitable for all surfaces. Delicate surfaces like some roofing materials, older brick, and some types of siding require soft washing techniques. Our team is trained to assess each surface and use the appropriate cleaning method to prevent damage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is soft washing and how is it different from pressure washing?",
    "answer": "Soft washing uses lower pressure combined with specialized cleaning solutions to safely remove dirt, algae, mold, and mildew from delicate surfaces. Unlike traditional pressure washing, soft washing relies more on the cleaning solutions to break down contaminants rather than high-pressure water, making it safer for surfaces that could be damaged by high pressure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you use environmentally friendly cleaning products?",
    "answer": "Yes, we prioritize using eco-friendly cleaning solutions that are effective yet safe for your property, plants, pets, and the environment. Our cleaning agents are biodegradable and designed to break down naturally without causing harm to surrounding vegetation or water systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does a typical pressure washing service take?",
    "answer": "The duration depends on the size of the area being cleaned and the level of dirt or contamination. A standard residential driveway might take 1-2 hours, while a complete home exterior package could take 3-5 hours. We'll provide you with a time estimate when we give you a quote."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to be home during the pressure washing service?",
    "answer": "No, you don't need to be present as long as we have access to the areas that need cleaning and water sources. However, we're happy to walk through the completed work with you if you're available when we finish."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much does pressure washing cost?",
    "answer": "Pricing varies based on the size of the area, level of dirt/contamination, and specific services needed. We provide free, detailed quotes after assessing your property's specific needs. Contact us for a personalized estimate."
  },
  {
    "question": "How soon can you schedule my service?",
    "answer": "We typically can schedule services within 1-2 weeks, though this may vary during peak seasons. For urgent situations, we do our best to accommodate rush appointments when our schedule allows."
